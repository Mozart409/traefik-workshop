## Documentation

This is just a placeholder project with some sample scripts, showing why using native clis is a pain.

```sh
psql -h host -d database -U user -W
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name TYPE column_constraint,
    table_constraint table_constraint
) INHERITS existing_table_name;
```
